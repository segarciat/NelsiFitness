# NelsiFitness

A mockup personal trainer site based on a real personal trainer, live https://nelsipamela.fit/.

## Description

Simple website based on my sister, with her permission, that she might use to share her passion for fitness culture. Besides the landing page, it includes a modal for calculating BMI and a simple application macronutrient calculator that computes the recommended daily caloric goal based on some inputted information.

## Technologies

For simplicity, the site only uses HTML, SASS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks.
