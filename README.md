# About

Welcome! My name is Sergio Garcia Tapia. This project is a website for a biki wellness athlete, who happens to be my sister. I made this with the intention of helping her spread her passion for fitness culture. It was a solo project, but I am grateful to have had some feedback about the layout from Sam Dedes.

## What's in the website.

The content is mostly generic, but it has an information feel, meant to motivate visitors of the page to start a routine in which they incorporate exercise and give more importance to nutrition. It also links to Nelsi's instagram page, where she regularly shares her everyday routine through Instagram stories. 

As for what can be found, it has:
- A single page with about 7 sections
- A simple BMI modal tool.
- A macro-calculator form application

## What technologies were used?

For the page, I used pure HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Everything was intentionally built from scratch without the aid from frameworks, from the layout and page animations to the macro and bmi tools. I used symbols from fontawesome as well.

## Macro Tool

The Macro Tool was an important part of the project for me, and it's one that took a lot of work. It allows a user to enter personal information in a form. The Calculate button is disabled until the user fills in all fields. Users can save their info, clear it from the form, edit it, delete it so that it's no longer saved, and filter through a list of saved users. All done in plain JavaScript.

## Deployment

I deployed the site with Netlify, a free service!
