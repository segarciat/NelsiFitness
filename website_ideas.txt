Ideas

About section:

1) Add a shadow to the image

2) Add a rounded border around each of the three list elements. We can add some color to that later. No link to this one.

3) As part of the text, mention that Nelsi currently works at Steel Factory, and maybe provide a link to its instagram page or something.

4) Add animations for the three list elements when hovered. Maybe like this page:

https://colorlib.com/preview/#bodyfit

under 'Our Process', or like in my previous page:

https://loving-goodall-28e667.netlify.com/index.html

in the 'Services' section. Maybe we can make the image enlarge slightly as well.

Commitment section:

1) Commitment points: goal, time, money. Mention the importance of discipline and consistency.

2) Horizontal vs vertical arrangement of commitment? 

a) Vertical might allow for two columns; one for the commitments and another for maybe like an image or slideshow.

Example: 

https://colorlib.com/preview/#bodyfit

in the fitness programs section.

b) Horizontal means it might look like the petsg website 'Services' section.

Might wanna use a symbol to represent each of the points, but for variety maybe use a square border this time. Adding some animations to them might be helpful. Perhaps the BMI tool could be accessible from here.

under 'Services'.



Nutrition Section:

1) Create a tool for calculating BMI like this website:

https://colorlib.com/preview/#fitzone

This will require Javascript. Should be fun :)

2) Create a tool for calculating target calorie goal, along with target macros. Also Javascript

3) Provide a default view, and provide buttons that, upon click, will change the view so that
   foods corresponding to a certain macro will display. May need Javascript for this

4) Table the nutrition section, thinking 2 rows 3 columns. Under the images, 
maybe have a brief explanation of the importance of that macronutrient

Exercise section:

1) Add a list of generic exercises, and link them to instructions on how to perform them. A box layout may work.

Example:

https://colorlib.com/preview/#crossfits

under Crossfit Experiences

2) Use fontawesome symbols maybe, or some images to represent the exercises. Color them with the theme color, and use either a square or circular border.
Between sections:
Maybe include an array of pictures that slide automatically
